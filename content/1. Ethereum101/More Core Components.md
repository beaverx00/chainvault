# 9 - [More Core Components](More%20Core%20Components.md)

1. [Consensus](content/1.%20Ethereum101/Consensus.md) algorithm: Ethereum uses Bitcoin’s consensus model, Nakamoto Consensus, which uses sequential single-signature blocks, weighted in importance by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to determine the longest chain and therefore the current state. 
2. However, this is being transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm in Ethereum 2.0.
3. Economic security: Ethereum currently uses a PoW algorithm called Ethash, but this is being transitioned to a PoS algorithm in [ETH 2.0](ETH%202.0.md).
4. Clients: Ethereum has several interoperable implementations of the client software, the most prominent of which are Go-Ethereum (Geth) and OpenEthereum. The others are Erigon, Nethermind and Turbo-geth. OpenEthereum is being deprecated to transition to Erigon, which is the former Turbo-geth.

# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)



The Ethereum Improvement Proposal
repository is located at <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/>.
 The
workflow is illustrated in [Ethereum Improvement Proposal
workflow](#eip_workflow).

From
[EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md):

> EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal. An EIP is a design
> document providing information to the Ethereum community, or
> describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment.
> The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the
> feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible
> for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting
> opinions.

| [EIP-140](http://bit.ly/2yJtWZm) | New Opcode: `REVERT`. Adds `REVERT` opcode instruction, which stops execution and rolls back the EVM execution state changes without consuming all provided gas (instead the contract only has to pay for memory) or losing logs, and returns to the caller a pointer to the memory location with the error code or message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Alex Beregszaszi, Nikolai Mushegian                            | Core       | Final                     | Metropolis Byzantinium |
